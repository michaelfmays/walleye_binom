  abstract = {Abstract Temperate lakes may contain both coolwater fish species such as walleye (Sander vitreus) and warmwater fish species such as largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides). Recent declining walleye and increasing largemouth bass populations have raised questions regarding the future trajectories and management actions for these species. We developed a thermodynamic model of water temperatures driven by downscaled climate data and lake-specific characteristics to estimate daily water temperature profiles for 2148 lakes in Wisconsin, US, under contemporary (1989â2014) and future (2040â2064 and 2065â2089) conditions. We correlated contemporary walleye recruitment and largemouth bass relative abundance to modeled water temperature, lake morphometry, and lake productivity, and projected lake-specific changes in each species under future climate conditions. Walleye recruitment success was negatively related and largemouth bass abundance was positively related to water temperature degree days. Both species exhibited a threshold response at the same degree day value, albeit in opposite directions. Degree days were predicted to increase in the future, although the magnitude of increase varied among lakes, time periods, and global circulation models (GCMs). Under future conditions, we predicted a loss of walleye recruitment in 33â75\% of lakes where recruitment is currently supported and a 27â60\% increase in the number of lakes suitable for high largemouth bass abundance. The percentage of lakes capable of supporting abundant largemouth bass but failed walleye recruitment was predicted to increase from 58\% in contemporary conditions to 86\% by mid-century and to 91\% of lakes by late century, based on median projections across GCMs. Conversely, the percentage of lakes with successful walleye recruitment and low largemouth bass abundance was predicted to decline from 9\% of lakes in contemporary conditions to only 1\% of lakes in both future periods. Importantly, we identify up to 85 resilient lakes predicted to continue to support natural walleye recruitment. Management resources could target preserving these resilient walleye populations.},

  abstract = {Despite the great economic and cultural importance of inland recreational fisheries, overharvest of inland fish stocks is rarely studied. We compared biomass harvest and biomass production in a unique 28-y, 179-lake dataset of a valuable inland fishery and found \~{}40\% of stocks to be overharvested, a rate \&gt;10{\texttimes} higher than population thresholds used to manage these fisheries. This is an empirical example of recreational fisheries overharvest in a declining fishery revealed through a biomass production approach. The high level of production overharvest we found highlights the value of ecosystem approaches to inform recreational fisheries management in an era of rapid environmental change.Recreational fisheries are valued at $190B globally and constitute the predominant way in which people use wild fish stocks in developed countries, with inland systems contributing the main fraction of recreational fisheries. Although inland recreational fisheries are thought to be highly resilient and self-regulating, the rapid pace of environmental change is increasing the vulnerability of these fisheries to overharvest and collapse. Here we directly evaluate angler harvest relative to the biomass production of individual stocks for a major inland recreational fishery. Using an extensive 28-y dataset of the walleye (Sander vitreus) fisheries in northern Wisconsin, United States, we compare empirical biomass harvest (Y) and calculated production (P) and biomass (B) for 390 lake year combinations. Production overharvest occurs when harvest exceeds production in that year. Biomass and biomass turnover (P/B) declined by \~{}30 and \~{}20\%, respectively, over time, while biomass harvest did not change, causing overharvest to increase. Our analysis revealed that \~{}40\% of populations were production-overharvested, a rate \&gt;10{\texttimes} higher than estimates based on population thresholds often used by fisheries managers. Our study highlights the need to adapt harvest to changes in production due to environmental change.},

  abstract = {Quasi-Poisson and negative binomial regression models have equal numbers of parameters, and either could be used for overdispersed count data. While they often give similar results, there can be striking differences in estimating the effects of covariates. We explain when and why such differences occur. The variance of a quasi-Poisson model is a linear function of the mean while the variance of a negative binomial model is a quadratic function of the mean. These variance relationships affect the weights in the iteratively weighted least-squares algorithm of fitting models to data. Because the variance is a function of the mean, large and small counts get weighted differently in quasi-Poisson and negative binomial regression. We provide an example using harbor seal counts from aerial surveys. These counts are affected by date, time of day, and time relative to low tide. We present results on a data set that showed a dramatic difference on estimating abundance of harbor seals when using quasi-Poisson vs. negative binomial regression. This difference is described and explained in light of the different weighting used in each regression method. A general understanding of weighting can help ecologists choose between these two methods.},

  abstract = {Abstract The areas beneath the relative (or receiver) operating characteristics (ROC) and relative operating levels (ROL) curves can be used as summary measures of forecast quality, but statistical significance tests for these areas are conducted infrequently in the atmospheric sciences. A development of signal-detection theory, the ROC curve has been widely applied in the medical and psychology fields where significance tests and relationships to other common statistical methods have been established and described. This valuable literature appears to be largely unknown to the atmospheric sciences where applications of ROC and related techniques are becoming more common. This paper presents a survey of that literature with a focus on the interpretation of the ROC area in the field of forecast verification. We extend these foundations to demonstrate that similar principles can be applied to the interpretation and significance testing of the ROL area. It is shown that the ROC area is equivalent to the MannâWhitney U-statistic testing the significance of forecast event probabilities for cases where events actually occurred with those where events did not occur. A similar derivation shows that the ROL area is equivalent to the MannâWhitney U-statistic testing the magnitude of events with respect to whether or not an event has been forecast. Because the MannâWhitney U-statistic follows a known probability distribution, under certain assumptions it can be used to define the statistical significance of ROC and ROL areas and for comparing the areas of competing forecasts. For large samples the significance of either measure can be accurately assessed using a normal-distribution approximation. Copyright Â© 2002 Royal Meteorological Society},

We added new data, explicitly tested for the linearity of the relationship, and accounted for the effect of measurement errors. We found that electrofishing CPE was nonlinearly related to the population density of age-0 walleyes, which indicated that the catchability of age-0 walleyes to electrofishing declined with population density. The measurement errors in electrofishing CPE were more than nine times as great as those in age-0 walleye population density, so that the parameters of the relationship between electrofishing CPE and age-0 walleye density were accurately estimated by ordinary-least-squares linear regression. Among lakes, the variation in the catchability of age-0 walleyes to electrofishing was positively related to the variation in specific conductivity but not to the variation in other physical features (shoreline complexity or littoral area) or chemical features (alkalinity or pH). Within lakes, the variation in the catchability of age-0 walleyes to electrofishing was negatively related to the variation in temperature at the time of sampling. We recommend that electrofishing CPE only be used as a crude index of age-0 walleye population density.},

  abstract = {Estimating abundance is important in many ecological studies in order to understand the spatial and temporal dynamics of a population, which can assist in management and conservation. However, direct estimates of abundance can be difficult and expensive to obtain, particularly for wide-ranging, rare or elusive species. An alternative – estimating from detection-nondetection data – is a challenging but alluring concept to ecologists since the cost and effort of a study can be greatly reduced. This paper describes a method for estimating the abundance of randomly distributed or aggregated populations by using binary data where the probability of detection is less than one. The performances of the models were evaluated by computer simulations comprising 1620 cases. The results show that the accuracy of the abundance estimates increases as the sampling rate, efficiency of survey method, and the number of repeated surveys increase, whereas the accuracy declines as individuals become more aggregated. For a randomly distributed population, using a sampling rate of 0.05 in a survey method with a detection probability of 0.5, and repeating surveys three times provides sufficient accuracy of abundance. For an aggregated population, to achieve reasonably accurate abundance estimates the sampling rate should be doubled and each cell should be repeatedly surveyed on 4 to 6 occasions.},

  abstract = {Summary N-mixture models have become a popular method for estimating abundance of free-ranging animals that are not marked or identified individually. These models have been used on count data for single species that can be identified with certainty. However, co-occurring species often look similar during one or more life stages, making it difficult to assign species for all recorded captures. This uncertainty creates problems for estimating species-specific abundance, and it can often limit life stages to which we can make inference. We present a new extension of N-mixture models that accounts for species uncertainty. In addition to estimating site-specific abundances and detection probabilities, this model allows estimating probability of correct assignment of species identity. We implement this hierarchical model in a Bayesian framework and provide all code for running the model in BUGS language programs. We present an application of the model on count data from two sympatric freshwater fishes, the brook stickleback (Culaea inconstans) and the ninespine stickleback (Pungitius pungitius), and illustrate implementation of covariate effects (habitat characteristics). In addition, we used a simulation study to validate the model and illustrate potential sample size issues. We also compared, for both real and simulated data, estimates provided by our model to those obtained by a simple N-mixture model when captures of unknown species identification were discarded. In the latter case, abundance estimates appeared highly biased and very imprecise, while our new model provided unbiased estimates with higher precision. This extension of the N-mixture model should be useful for a wide variety of studies and taxa, as species uncertainty is a common issue. It should notably help improve investigation of abundance and vital rate characteristics of organisms’ early life stages, which are sometimes more difficult to identify than adults.},
